# Test Image URLs for Jewelry Shop

Use these URLs to test the admin product form - these should definitely work:

## Method 1: GitHub Images (Recommended)
These are hosted on GitHub and should always work:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode/main/resources/linux/code.png
```

## Method 2: Lorem Picsum (Reliable)
Generates random images, great for testing:

```
https://picsum.photos/400/300?random=1
https://picsum.photos/400/300?random=2  
https://picsum.photos/400/300?random=3
```

## Method 3: JSONPlaceholder (Reliable)
Small placeholder images:

```
https://via.placeholder.com/400x300/0066CC/FFFFFF?text=Diamond+Ring
https://via.placeholder.com/400x300/FFD700/000000?text=Gold+Necklace
https://via.placeholder.com/400x300/FF69B4/FFFFFF?text=Ruby+Earrings
```

## Instructions:
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Add Product
2. Use any of the URLs above as image URLs
3. Complete the rest of the form
4. Submit and check homepage

## If still not working:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for any error messages
3. Check if images array is populated correctly
4. Verify the image URLs are being sent to the server properly
